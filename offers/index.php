 		<p>Now in its 6th year funtime Friday is our extended happy hour here at the CoB.</p>
 		<p>We welcome all comers in to celebrate the end of their working week with drinks and free nibbles. &pound;2.50 for our pints, ales, 175ml glass of wine, most spirit mixers and we also do a cocktail of the week for &pound;3.50 just for those who really want to celebrate.</p>
		<p>A tradition here at the CoB - when a child brings their parent along for Sunday lunch they get a free main course with each paying adult!  Food is served from 12noon - 8pm (we recommend you get mummy or daddy to book).  Offer on all Sundays except public holidays & Mothers/Fathers Day.</p>
