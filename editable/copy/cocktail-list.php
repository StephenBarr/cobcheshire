    <p>In the midst of Cheshire a motley crew of bartenders put their heads together to create a page of cocktails worthy of our loyal drinkers...... One man said lets have four sections, another wise man exclaimed - how about three drinks in each section and here the journey began......</p>
    <p>We have travelled far and wide, drank liqueurs and cocktails 'til our tastebuds could stand no more and scoured ancient journals to come up with these drinks...... and here it is...... A section of.... Winter warmers..... Fruity delights & Fizzes.... but we couldn't come up with any more so we stole some ideas from our sister bar Voodoo and stuck that in too!! We hope you like our choices!
