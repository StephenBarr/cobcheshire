		    <p>Hi Alethea</p>
 		    <p>I just wanted to say a huge thank you to you and the team at CoB for making our wedding day such an amazing event. We loved every minute of it and the staff at CoB looked after us all so well.  We would heartily recommend the CoB for a wedding ...or any party/occasion ....you are a great team!</p>
 		    <p>A big huge thank you once again</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>It really was the best of our lives...thanks to you!</strong></p>
		    <p>Hello Alethea !!!</p>
            <p>I don't really know where to start, so I think the beginning may be best ! From the first meeting with you , we had made our minds up that the Cock o Barton was the perfect wedding venue. I didn't even look anywhere else, much to people's surprise, but I knew this was the best we'd find. Alethea, you made the whole process an absolute breeze, it was a real joy working out our wedding plans with you, with both of us feeling no stress at all. Nothing was a problem, you gave us the venue and said do what you want ! Your advice and calm attitude turned the planning of our big day into something really enjoyable, and also more importantly a day we could make our very own, the decor, the wine, and the food !</p>
            <p>Wow, the food !! It was superb. It was such a buzz to see everything we planned and talked about come out perfectly, even better than we had imagined. Everyone said it was the best wedding food they'd ever had. It was creative, fun, delicious, and it said a lot about James and I, the passion we have for food, and inspirations from our travels. we just couldn't have got this freedom, and a brilliant chef anywhere else. It was great to see everyone tucking in, sharing, questioning, smiling, when the food was presented, dish after dish. James was particularly pleased with the shot of real ale and pork scratching ;) I just want to eat it all again !!</p>
		    <p>We also have to mention the staff, they were fantastic. Even more comments about them from our guests, asking us if we'd hired them in specially as they were so good !! We obviously already knew the high standard of customer service having visited you a few times. They are some of the most professional hardworking people i've seen in this industry. Constantly pleasant, nothing was a problem, and really eager to make sure everyone was having a good time. The lady that was running the show, apologies, I forget her name ! She was great, it was lovely for both us to just sit back and know all we had to do was just enjoy ourselves, we cant praise her and all the guys and girls who work there enough !!</p>
		    <p>It really was the best day of our lives, and thats all thanks to you ! Thank you Alethea, for not only being a complete pro at wedding organisation, great ideas, and how open minded you were, but for becoming what we regard as a friend, which in turn made the planning,the build up and the day itself so very special. I would do it all again, with James obviously ! tomorrow ! We loved it, and not only did we think it was the best day ever, our guests still talk about it, and say it was the best wedding they'd ever been to. That speaks volumes about the venue, the setting and all of you at the Cock O Barton, I just hope we have an excuse to hold another party there in the future. Until then, we really look forward to visiting you soon, the drinks are on us!</p>
		    <p>With love , Mr & Mrs Morgan xx</p>

          <blockquote><p><strong>Everything could be tailored exactly to our needs</strong></p>
            <p>From the moment we first met Alethea, we knew our wedding at the Cock O Barton was going to be everything we hoped for. Everything could be tailored exactly to our needs and nothing was too big an ask - including stringing 500 origami birds in the windows and setting up 40 paper windmills in pots for us on the morning of the wedding! That, plus the fact that the place is gorgeous and we knew we'd found our perfect venue.</p>
            <p>On the day the team were amazing, ensuring everything went smoothly and getting us from ceremony, to drinks reception, to meal to evening reception without us ever having to think about timings ourselves. The food was delicious and all our guests loved that they were able to make their own choices (one month in advance) from a menu we'd put together. We loved that, putting together the menu, it was no issue whatsoever for the chef if we substituted ingredients we weren't so keen on for ones we liked and could even choose meals we'd had elsewhere and enjoyed for our menu.</p>
            <p>We'd like to thank the Cock O Barton for making our day a truly special, personal and memorable occasion. We'd highly, highly recommend the place to anyone and can't wait to come back ourselves for dinner soon.</p>

			<p>Hi Alethea</p>
			<p>Hope you are well</p>
			<p>We just wanted to say a big thank you to you and the rest of the team. We had a fantastic day, couldn't of asked for anything better. Jane, Lewy and Rachel were amazing on the day, they made sure everything ran like clockwork. The rest of the team were also great, everyone was so accommodating. We had so many compliments about the food and how lovely the venue was.</p>
			<p>Thank you for everything you did with the organising, it all came together perfectly. I don't know what to do with myself now I've got nothing to plan.</p>
			<p>Thanks again for helping us have an amazing day.</p>
			<p>All the best</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>From start to finish you have been so helpful</strong></p>
            <p>I would just like to say a massive thank you to you and all of the staff at the CoB for giving me and my husband the most amazing wedding day last Saturday.  From start to finish you have been so helpful and friendly and I didn't have to worry about a single thing on the day as absolutely everything was taken care of. Everyone has been saying how beautiful the CoB was and how wonderful the staff were. The freedom you gave us to decorate the room was amazing and your constant fast replies to my emails were always so helpful. It was an absolutely perfect day!</p>
			<p>Thank you!</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>We had a brilliant day, everything was perfect</strong></p>
			<p>Hi Alethea,</p>
			<p>I would just like to formally, sincerely Thankyou for all your help and hard work in making our wedding day what it was. You are a lovely lady with a wonderfully calm yet confident manner, I had no doubt that you would create the perfect day for us.</p>
			<p>We had a brilliant day, everything was perfect, the ladies that looked after us in the day were a dream.
In particular both Lyndsey and Amy, I know Phil has also emailed to express his thanks too.</p>
			<p>Can I just say also that Amy was just brilliant with our youngest daughter Evie who can be quite A handful. Phil and I watched as Amy was just about to take her break in the late afternoon, Evie said to her 'so what are we doing next?' Instead of saying she was going to take a well deserved break, she replied...' come on then, what shall we do next' and they walked off together! She was a star!! So again, Thankyou to everyone!</p>
			<p>Thankyou so much</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>It is truly a fantastic venue</strong></p>
			<p>A fabulous venue with the most helpful, friendly and professional people - we honestly couldn't fault Alethea and the team at the Cock O Barton - our wedding day was perfect!</p>
			<p>We chose the Cock O Barton as it has character and versatility plus we wanted somewhere we could have exclusive use without doubling the price when we mentioned weddings.  Alethea and the team were very helpful throughout the planning stages, nothing was too much trouble and we always felt very welcome at the venue. </p>
			<p>The food choices were delicious, varied and excellent value - so many of our guests said it was the best meal they had ever had at a wedding.  The vegetarian options were much more exciting than the normal offerings in other venues and we were encouraged to adapt the dishes to best suit us and our guests.</p>
			<p>On the day itself I left the decoration of the venue and tables to the COB team and it was done to perfection.  The team handled the day very smoothly, ensuring that the room change around between daytime and evening was quick and they kept us to our schedule without being pushy.  As the day went on we needed to be reminded of what was happening next as it felt like a whirlwind of pictures and glasses of Prossecco.  We had lovely weather and some great photo opportunities within the COB and the surrounding village of Barton. There are also some beautiful places to stay in the local area.</p>
			<p>The evening reception went on late and the staff at the COB remained friendly and professional at all times.  I would love to do the whole day again as it all went so fast but as that's not possible we will definitely be returning to the Cock O Barton for meals whenever we can.  It is truly a fantastic venue and I've had people - young and old - tell me it was the best wedding they have ever been to.</p>
			<p>I cannot recommend this place enough - and we visited quite a few venues before we chose this one.  If you want something a little different from the standard stately home/hotel conveyor belt wedding then this is definitely the place!</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>A totally bespoke wedding day experience</strong></p>
 			<p>From the warm welcome the moment we entered The Cock O' Barton regarding our wedding we were confident that we would have our reception day there! We visited many venues to compare but non offered a totally bespoke wedding day experience that we actually wanted.</p>
			<p>Alethea and the team were excellent through the months of preparation and throughout our day! Our Wedding from start to finish was absolutely amazing at the Cock O'Barton. Alethea and staff were always very warm, welcoming and friendly and certainly nothing was too much trouble. In fact, a large number of our guests commented on the great venue, staff and quality of food. They have been so impressed they have visited with friends and family for meals afterwards.</p>
			<p>We would without doubt recommend the Cock O'Barton, for your wedding - we will always have fantastic memories of our wedding day and have gained some friends too.</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>Everything was planned to perfection</strong></p>
			<p>Our wedding reception at the CoB was fantastic and we would highly recommend the CoB to anyone and everyone.
Alethea was amazing from the first meeting we had to the day of our wedding.  Everything was planned to perfection from the fabulous marquee to seat 150 guests which Alethea herself helped us decorate down to the small details such as the position of the napkins at everyone's place setting.  Nothing was too much trouble for Alethea and her help was invaluable in arranging our special day.
All the CoB staff on the day were brilliant especially Jane who made the day run smoothly and was extremely helpful.</p>
			<p>The food was absolutely delicious and we had loads of comments from our guest on how tasty it was.  It was also great to find somewhere that didn't pressurise us into having a certain set menu and price; we were able to arrange a fabulous menu within our budget.</p>
			<p>We were very lucky with the weather on our day and had the whole venue to ourselves which was amazing.  Our guests had a brilliant time and commented on the fantastic venue, the delicious food and the very relaxed atmosphere that you get at the COB.
We'd like to sincerely thank everyone for making our wedding day so amazing and if you haven't chosen your wedding venue yet then look no further!</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>Alethea and her team were excellent throughout!</strong></p>
			<p>From the moment I contacted The Cock O' Barton regarding our wedding I was confident that we would be married there! Alethea and her team were excellent throughout! Every little thing was followed to the 'T' nothing was too small or insignificant and the whole day ran soooo smoothly!</p>
			<p>The value for money was excellent and I never thought I would find a wedding venue that would try and help me save money by making suggestions where &pound;'s could be shaved!</p>
			<p>The food was gorgeous, we had loads of comments about how good it was! I don't have a single complaint! They truely helped this bride to be, who didn't have a clue, pull off a perfect day :)</p>

		  <blockquote><p><strong>I would whole heartily recommend</strong></p>
 			<p>Our Wedding from start to finish was absolutely wonderful at the Cock O'Barton.  From the moment of looking at the venue for our wedding, to the actual Wedding Day,  the staff were very warm, friendly and certainly nothing was too much trouble. 
All communication with the Wedding Co-Ordinator (Alethea) was brilliant, again nothing too much trouble.</p>
			<p>On the day, well the weather was on our side, and the service from start to finish was exemplary.  In fact, a number of my guests commented on the good service from staff and they were very impressed with the venue. </p>
			<p>The Cock O'Barton is also good value for money, the food is yummy and plenty of it !!</p> 
			<p>I would whole heartily recommend any bride (and groom) to have their ceremony & wedding breakfast/evening do at the Cock O'Barton - we have very fond memories of our wedding day and even my husband said he would do it all again as the venue/arrangements were excellent !!</p>

			<p>Food was to die for and your staff left no stone unturned.</p>
